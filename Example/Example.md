In this Vue.js code, we have an input field and a list of todo items.

When you type something in the input field and press the enter key, a new todo item will be added to the list. Each todo item can be removed by clicking the "Remove" button.

The data and methods for the Vue component are defined in the `<script>` tag. The styling is done in the `<style>` tag.
